9007_red	red	Investigate using differentially private models of EHR data to enrich the FDAs adverse event reporting system. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting system has played a central role in drug safety surveillance for decades despite limitations in the quality and depth of data available. Modern differential privacy models allow for the release of rich clinical data without comprising security. There is an opportunity to use differentially private models applied to EHR data to enrich publicly available resources. We believe that publicly releasing a companion dataset of privacy secured EHR data to accompany the FDA AERS will amplify the discovery process. Further, such a release and integrative analysis vision is in scope to the goals of the NCATS translator. This work will be done in collaboration in Roxana Geambasu (Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University) and her team who is externally funded.

9008_red	red	Harden the Data2Services Framework Prototype. We have been developing a Data2Services framework to automatically process heterogeneous data (CSV, XML, JSON) into standardized data formats (e.g. JSON, JSON-LD, N-Triples, CSV) and services (SPARQL endpoint, GraphQL endpoint, Beacon API) all documented with the smartAPI standard. New work is required to add adapters, harden the framework, and to facilitate its deployment for an arbitrary dataset. We will demonstrate the framework by applying it to high value datasets to the Translator effort, and testing their inclusion in Translator Reasoners. Users will be able to manually configure to target data models, such as the BioLink model. Data2Services will enhance the availability of structured data to Reasoners by reducing the burden to quickly providing a variety of interfaces to the source data.

9009_red	red	Semantically Enhance Data2Services. The Data2Services framework will automatically produce semantic mappings between the source data and the target data model. However, the framework cannot tap into existing terminologies and ontologies to annotate data with specific concepts and relations. To address this limitation, we will use (semi)-automated methods that use a combination of i) NLP-based concept recognition, ii) profiling of the value space, range and lexical datatypes, and iii) machine learning method to concept assignment.

9010_red	red	Incorporate Network-based quality metrics . We have developed an automated data quality assessment pipeline to assess the quality of the Translator datasets according to six quality dimensions: Syntactic Validity, Consistency, Licensing, Interoperability, Timeliness and Relevancy. We will apply the pipeline to the Translator datasets to provide a quality report for each of them that will be included in the Reasoner tools be used as criteria for selecting datasets to query based on their quality report. Additionally, we will implement network-based quality assessment metrics, based on prior work, to measure the Interlinking and Relevancy dimensions. These quality metrics and reports will inform the Translator tools about the quality of the datasets according to the different dimensions, which are important from the different use cases/research questions perspectives.

9011_red	red	Start-To-End demonstration of Data2Services + Data Quality + Reasoner Pipeline    We will deploy our Data2Services and Data Quality Assessment frameworks on the NCATS infrastructure for a wide set of priority datasets. We will collaborate with receptive Reasoner groups to demonstrate their utility in answering key competency questions, including weighting of answers based on quality assessments. Here are some of the main ongoing and desired developments over the next year based on discussions with other teams at the May Hackathon:    Ongoing: Semantic level prevalence and co-occurrence analysis incorporating concept hierarchy and COHD API enhancements to choose concepts at the appropriate hierarchical level (X-ray)  Desired: Graph-based analysis of concept associations to identify confounding factors (Purple)  Desired: SmartAPI documentation of input and output data types to enhance semantic interoperability and integration with BioThings Explorer (Orange)  Desired: COHD front end user interface and network visualization to allow users to manually explore COHD data (Blue)   Other general planned directions for enhancing COHD that are not associated with collaborations or inspired by discussion with other Translator teams but would nevertheless benefit Translator:  Restricting the temporal window for co-occurrences  Stratifying data by demographics (ethnicity, race, sex, and age)	Architecture	clinical data; knowledge base; quality control	1						FALSE									FALSE	FALSE		clinical data,knowledge base,quality control	None listed	None listed	Clinical

10001_Near_IR	red, infrared	Mobile (SMS+) application for two-way communication of medication safety information. Sequence of questions prompt user to walk through a knowledge graph, specifying a disease, medication, and side effect. Information from the knowledge graph, as well as clinical and public side effect data lookups is presented to the user throughout the interaction as (1) prompts for further information or (2) a safety report that can be viewed and (a) saved for reference or (b) submitted to a clinical database. Inference algorithms support hypothesis generation and evaluation for rare and previously unreported side effects. Potential users are patients, clinicians, researchers, and staff in clinical trials and real world settings.
