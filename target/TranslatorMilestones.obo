This will allow us to uncover meaningful or novel co-occurrence frequency patterns. This includes multiple knowledge-based enrichment analyses for clinical data. We will verify the patterns in the large OHDSI network by collaborating with other data source providers. The significance of this project is that it can help us aggregate scattered statistics due to the highly specified and fragmented concept definitions and enable us to perform co-occurrence analysis at the semantic level and leverage knowledge to support it.

The FDA Adverse Event Reporting system has played a central role in drug safety surveillance for decades despite limitations in the quality and depth of data available. Modern differential privacy models allow for the release of rich clinical data without comprising security. There is an opportunity to use differentially private models applied to EHR data to enrich publicly available resources. We believe that publicly releasing a companion dataset of privacy secured EHR data to accompany the FDA AERS will amplify the discovery process. Further, such a release and integrative analysis vision is in scope to the goals of the NCATS translator. This work will be done in collaboration in Roxana Geambasu (Professor of Computer Science at Columbia University) and her team who is externally funded. " []

New work is required to add adapters, harden the framework, and to facilitate its deployment for an arbitrary dataset. We will demonstrate the framework by applying it to high value datasets to the Translator effort, and testing their inclusion in Translator Reasoners. Users will be able to manually configure to target data models, such as the BioLink model.
