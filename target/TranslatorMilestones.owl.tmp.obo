Sequence of questions prompt user to walk through a knowledge graph, specifying a disease, medication, and side effect. Information from the knowledge graph, as well as clinical and public side effect data lookups is presented to the user throughout the interaction as (1) prompts for further information or (2) a safety report that can be viewed and (a) saved for reference or (b) submitted to a clinical database. Inference algorithms support hypothesis generation and evaluation for rare and previously unreported side effects.

def: "Big Data 2 Association Miner API. Given the usefulness of large measurement data in Translator workflows, we will design an automated workflow to transform (possibly several related) large feature matrices (data tables of samples by features) into a set of sensible Translator questions that can be answered using a fully operational API interface. We will use the Google Cloud Platform and Google Big Query to host the data as well as perform the computation. This will ensure scalability, reproducibility and security. We would welcome Translator teams to suggest and/or provide datasets around which we would build APIs that directly integrate with Translator. Our initial goal would be to re-create Big CLAM (Cell Line Association Miner) using this workflow. Big CLAM involves 10+ feature matrices from three different cell line projects (GDSC, CMap, CDM).

There is an opportunity to use differentially private models applied to EHR data to enrich publicly available resources. We believe that publicly releasing a companion dataset of privacy secured EHR data to accompany the FDA AERS will amplify the discovery process. Further, such a release and integrative analysis vision is in scope to the goals of the NCATS translator.

def: "Semantically Enhance Data2Services. The Data2Services framework will automatically produce semantic mappings between the source data and the target data model. However, the framework cannot tap into existing terminologies and ontologies to annotate data with specific concepts and relations. To address this limitation, we will use (semi)-automated methods that use a combination of i) NLP-based concept recognition, ii) profiling of the value space, range and lexical datatypes, and iii) machine learning method to concept assignment."

name: Incorporate Network-based quality metrics
def: "Incorporate Network-based quality metrics . We have developed an automated data quality assessment pipeline to assess the quality of the Translator datasets according to six quality dimensions: Syntactic Validity, Consistency, Licensing, Interoperability, Timeliness and Relevancy. We will apply the pipeline to the Translator datasets to provide a quality report for each of them that will be included in the Reasoner tools be used as criteria for selecting datasets to query based on their quality report. Additionally, we will implement network-based quality assessment metrics, based on prior work, to measure the Interlinking and Relevancy dimensions. These quality metrics and reports will inform the Translator tools about the quality of the datasets according to the different dimensions, which are important from the different use cases/research questions perspectives."

def: "Start-To-End demonstration of Data2Services + Data Quality + Reasoner Pipeline      We will deploy our Data2Services and Data Quality Assessment frameworks on the NCATS infrastructure for a wide set of priority datasets. We will collaborate with receptive Reasoner groups to demonstrate their utility in answering key competency questions, including weighting of answers based on quality assessments. Here are some of the main ongoing and desired developments over the next year based on discussions with other teams at the May Hackathon:      Ongoing: Semantic level prevalence and co-occurrence analysis incorporating concept hierarchy and COHD API enhancements to choose concepts at the appropriate hierarchical level (X-ray)   Desired: Graph-based analysis of concept associations to identify confounding factors (Purple)   Desired: SmartAPI documentation of input and output data types to enhance semantic interoperability and integration with BioThings Explorer (Orange)   Desired: COHD front end user interface and network visualization to allow users to manually explore COHD data (Blue)     Other general planned directions for enhancing COHD that are not associated with collaborations or inspired by discussion with other Translator teams but would nevertheless benefit Translator:   Restricting the temporal window for co-occurrences   Stratifying data by demographics (ethnicity, race, sex, and age) " []
